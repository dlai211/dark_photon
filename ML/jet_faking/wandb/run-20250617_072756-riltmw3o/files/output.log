/home/jlai/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/xgboost/core.py:158: UserWarning: [07:28:25] WARNING: /workspace/src/common/error_msg.cc:58: Falling back to prediction using DMatrix due to mismatched devices. This might lead to higher memory usage and slower performance. XGBoost is running on: cuda:0, while the input data is on: cpu.
Potential solutions:
- Use a data structure that matches the device ordinal in the booster.
- Set the device for booster before call to inplace_predict.

This warning will only be shown once.

A worker stopped while some jobs were given to the executor. This can be caused by a too short worker timeout or by a memory leak.
